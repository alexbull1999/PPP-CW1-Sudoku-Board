Summarise your findings here (see specification).

I believe the three mystery puzzles to be the following: 

mystery1.dat = 'extremely hard' difficulty

mystery2.dat = impossible to solve 

mystery3.dat = 'hard' difficulty

These conclusions are due to the following: 

Mystery2.dat was the only board my sudoku program could not solve, so that identification is relatively straightforward

To judge between Mystery1.dat and Mystery3.dat, my first approach was to implement a counter to keep track of the number of times the solve_board function was called recursively for each board. This would give an indication of the level of complexity of each board.

Initially this was difficult to implement as I was trying to implement a counter within the solve_board function itself; with the problem that this didn't reset back to 0 between the different boards being called.

I then realised that I could take advantage of C++'s polymorphism to have two solve_board functions. One that was triggered by the calls to solve_board from main, that initialised the recursion counter to zero, before calling the "proper" solve board funnction, which uses the recursion counter as a reference parameter,incrementing it with every additional call.

Doing so enabled me to see that the Mystery1 board's recursion counter stood at 421,546 recursive calls, whereas Mystery3 board's counter was only 14,133 - and hence was the far simpler board. 

To double check, I had heard classmates talk about being to use a timer in C++, so looked up how to use the timer functions from the <chrono> library and implemented a clock, that started upon the first call of solve_board from main, and only finished once the board had finally been solved (or failed to be solved).

The clock confirmed the recursion counter's findings, insofar as the Mystery1 board took 131.461 ms to be solved, whilst the Mystery3 board took only 4.7331 ms to solve. 

A further thing I would note, however is the following: 

- When testing my solve_board function on the 'medium.dat' board, my recursion counter showed 15,661 recursive calls, whilst my timer showed it took 7.33721 ms to solve. 
Both of those are larger than their comparative values were for the Mystery3.dat board. 

So perhaps the naming of Mystery3.dat as "hard" (per the spec), vs. the naming of the 'medium.dat' board as medium is misleading?
Either the medium is also hard, or the Mystery3.dat is more of a medium board!
